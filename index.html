            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as 
               one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in 
               which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every 
               point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The 
               airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, 
               not in theory.

                To go places and do things that have never been done 
                before – that’s what living is all about.

            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. 
               But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological 
               dangers also come from science.What was most significant about the lunar voyage 
               was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth. That's 
               how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and 
               cherish her</p>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and 
               literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one 
               makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.For those who have seen the Earth 
               from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience 
               most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far 
               more valuable than those which divide you.

            <blockquote>
               The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has 
               not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little 
               for the next ten.
